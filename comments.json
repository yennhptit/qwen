I increased the exposure, removed the bokeh CA, saturated the reds, mirrored the right eye to the left eye to remove the glare. I used the liquify tool to give her a bit of a squinch. I lowered the clarity over the boob area because the edge there was really harsh.\n\nShe should really consider getting anti-reflective coatings on her glasses. Overall, I like the lighting.\n\nRadiant sunlight version",

But For your leading lines mostly lead away from the girl, though, not toward her. If you had her on the 1/3 line on the right side of the photo it might be more effective because then the leading line would be where she was about to go. As it is she is cutting the leading line off, my eyes go up the path but her torso cuts stops me.\n\nI think in the most interesting version of this photo would have basically the same framing but the girl would be riding towards you on the right side of the photo. Faces are more interesting than the backs of heads and the path would then show where she had just come from without her cutting the leading line off.",

The reason for using a grid of 12ths is that this allows us to see proportions based on the rule of 3rds, and so on. It also gives us a convenient guide for seeing if things are level.\n\nimage_url\n\nwe see that the horizon is not level, and that the tree is not quite precisely located for the rule of thirds here. I feel extra precision would be good here.\n\nThe better way of doing this would be to have a wider picture by adding space to the left side, if you shot a larger picture to begin with. other wise you could crop a bit from the right side, but that is a lesser solution.\n\nIf we look at this more closely, we find that the tree is located squarely left to right on a grid based on 11ths.\n\nimage_url\n\nso we could level the photo, and if we trim one row of the 1/12th grid from the top or the bottom, everything lines up on a grid of 11ths.\n\nThis is a more subtle alignment that might not appeal to every one.\n\nPeople tend to relate more positively to simple proportions, but also to patterns in general.\n\nHere is what it would look like with this crop based on a grid of 11ths\n\nimage_url\n\nand how it looks with the grid of 11ths on top of it\n\nimage_url\n\nThis also makes the least amount of change to bring the best out of the photo\n\nThe simple trick is to find proportions and patterns in the original photo that you can take advantage of.\n\nAll images\n\nimage_url",

        "comment": "First of all, I appreciate anyone looking for alternative angles and approaches to much-photographed scenes. That is what pushes 'boundaries' and so-called limits. I like what you have done here, but I'm going to go against the grain a bit. I view any forum/activity where photo critique is asked for as a place that should be full of honest opinions.\n\nSo there is my thought. With no more accreditation than me being a stranger at the end of an ethernet connections: I think it's good, but not great. There is a TON of potential here though, especially if you have an opportunity to revisit and work the scene some more.\n\n-dead center subject: I generally find this approach a bit static, and I'm certainly guilty of it. I'll post a link for a very fast crop example that I think works better below. -what is the subject? My eye wanders all over the place seeking a place to land. The eye in general is drawn to the brightest part of a scene. Unfortunately, the brights part of this scene is the blown-pout sky. My point about the comp above can also help reinforce the subject. -The foreground foliage: adds nothing, but takes away a lot. You've lost almost a third of your image space to dark shadows that add (arguably) little to the frame. -I get the comments around balance/symmetry, but I find it static. -color cast. Some of that is really just the natural light. It's a gray day with overcast skies. Great for terrestrial subjects where that overcast can be a giant softbox. Very hard to work with for images with a lot of sky like this. -to the with of the tower, about mid-frame, there is a long growth from the plant. The placement happens to be a a bad spot, and even more so when you crop to highlight the subject more.\n\nI hope you don't mind, but I grabbed a copy and did 30-seconds worth of editing. (1) cropped to emphasize the subject more (IMHO). (2) A quick heal on the area of the foliage left side. Could have left alone with the people showing through, but... (3) Pulled back the highlights just a little to get a tiny bit more detail in the sky.\n\nHere is a quick link. I'll gladly pull down and delete if preferred. image_url\n\nTake none of this personal, but simply a genuine attempt to offer my useless opinions on how it might be improved.",

Of course, it is a matter of preference, but one of the strengths of black and white landscapes is the focus on tonality, shape, and global contrast without color distracting.\n\nLook at what Ansel Adams does (e.g. or e.g.). Dramatic lighting, dark darks and light lights emphasize the scene and the shape of the landscape. In snake river, the white river contrasted against the black trees leads the eyes and shows the scene has volume. You could stand ten feet away and blur your eyes and still tell it was a great landscape.\n\nYou might be used to straying away from bright whites and deep blacks with color photos, but don't be afraid to go there with black and white landscapes. Of course, don't get heavy handed or use contrasty black and white editing to all landscapes, but when you take a landscape, ask what draws your eyes and you will know which style of editing to do. If its the way the light lays over the land or the overall shape of the scene, this style of black and white image will work very well.",

You could crop the photo to just the gondola and it’s reflection and I think it’s amazing. It has a dreamy texture like a painting. I can post a screenshot of what I have in mind if you like.

A tripod would have served you well here.\n\nhaving been here at sunset, Nine exposures was almost certainly unneeded to capture the dynamic range in this scene.\n\nthe X-T2's sensor is pretty close to iso invariant. Combining iso bracketed exposures is appropriately the equivalent to merging with a photo where you pushed exposure in post, which is about the same as just lifting the shadows in a single photo exposed for the sky\n\nI own the 16-80 and the IS on that lens is a beast. I can reliably get shots down to 1/8 and I wouldn't say I have the steadiest hands. That would have given you two more stops of light\n\nat 19mm you probably could have shot at f8 and had front to back sharpness with another stop of light.\n\nYou ended up with a pretty noisy image overall here. I'm not sure what stacking got you as I am guessing you could have exposed to the right at ~1/8 | f8 | iso 160 and gotten a cleaner inage from one exposure.\n\nOn to the editing. Here is an example of how I would edit this photo.\n\nExposure Everything feels a little flat and washed out, almost like log video before it's been graded. I would decrease exposure by about a stop and then adjust highlights and shadows to increase contrast.\n\nColor white balance feels pretty blue/green, especially for a photo in red rock county. I would warm up the shot and push the tint a bit towards magenta.\n\nlocal edits I would use a few gradient filters to darken down the valley a bit and add a nice gradient to the sky.\n\nEdit: forgot to mention that I think a 4:5 crop serves this better than square.",

I don't know what soil level you're at so please disregard my comments if you already are aware.\n\nFirst I would thought up the picture for a few reasons. First, this looks like it's happening way off yonder. Zooming in would take you right into the action. As it is now we're almost too far off to really care. Also with us seeing SOOOooo much of the background, it is obviously a \"Movie Miniature\" type of shot. If you tighten up the image you can create a disconnected background. The shapes and colors are right and the imagery is right for this background, disconnecting it lets us accept that background as being legit, but it also let's us accept that it's so far off way back there, that we don't see it as being abnormally large. Your forcing that perspective.\n\nI noticed you shot the image at f/4. I looked up that lens and discovered that is constant. If you could have raised that f/stop into a middle range of stops on the lens you could have played with the ISO and shutter speed and lengthen that DOF and given yourself a greater percentage chance that everyting you wanted to be in focus, was. I'm not sure how much adjust you can do to your DOF with a set f/stop.\n\nTo me it looks like the train is moving (for real, like you taped up the trigger so the train could just run nonstop) If you had set the train still you could still use the compresses air to fly your dust storm but that train would be in tack sharp focus. And now that we zoomed in to take us into the action, we also disconnected the tail of the train as well. You could add as much motion blur as your heart desires, or at least as much as some of the pickier people on the sub can let you get away with.\n\nI'm curious why you shot at 1/4000 of shower speed. Even if the train were zooming along, a slower shutter speed could do the trick and possibly given you some wiggle room on your DOF. ie...1/250 shutter would be fast enough to freeze the train.\n\nI hope you don't mind, but I cropped the photo too give you an idea of what I'm talking about. Please forgive the crappiness...I did this all on my phone, whilst teaching my son math… which I will admit I completely and terribly suck at period both the math and the teaching of math 🤪🤪.\n\nMiniature train image_url",

The eye lashes are SHARP while the eyes are only mostly sharp. Being able to shoot wide open at 1.8 is soooo much fun but when you're that close to the subject's face, your depth of field is razor thin. Don't be afraid to stop down to 2.8. 2.8 that close to the subject will still blur the background but it'll sharpen what you want to be sharp. Again, great work!",

That would have made the lone flower pop out more. You might have been able to achieve this by slightly elevating and shooting down.

I do moody portraits so this pic is great, I love the blue tones that you went with. The dark hair and clothing also works really well with the style, First lets set the tone curve. I went with a very narrow S bend and ever so slightly matted the blacks. Next I would increase the overall saturation on the picture but be carful to not go crazy as the skin tends to get a little discolored. Up the shadows so you can really see the definition in her hair line and the water tension. I desaturated the reds and magenta a bit to deal with the skin tone and put a few touches on the eyes to really bring them to life (remember here if you up-ed the blues the resulting whites of the eyes need to be desaturated and whitened.) Play with the color sliders to get a good balance between the yellows and oranges so you don't make the skin look lifeless. I'm not one for graining so I actually bumped the overall clarity to about 6. I threw a heavy vignette to really create a focus on her face and and lots of drama to the picture. The split toning, I set the highlights hue to 229 and the saturation to 35 to really max the blue water color furthering that moody feel. Here's how mine turned out. Overall, great shot and keep practicing! Remember if you picture doesn't feel like it's living and breathing, you're not done editing!",

I'd straighten her out (she's a little off-kilter), and do a little color grading. I feel like this scene calls for some greens and blues, but heavily desaturated. Maybe add a little film grain, and some vignetting. Pump the contrast dramatically. I downloaded the jpg you posted and gave it a quick edit in lightroom to sort of demonstrate my thinking. Here you go. - obviously, it would all look better on the RAW file out of camera, but this should give you some idea of a place to start to bring out some cinematic drama.",

Personally, I think the shot itself is well executed, could use some editing to make it have more of a darker feel to it. I started by removing the edges of the bathtub to add more mystery as to where the setting is. Then, I decided to desaturate and darken the edges, making it so the subjects face became more of a focal point, making it pop. I messed with the shadows and highlights, making her facial structure and eyes more defined and dramatic. Finally, I sprinkled a tiny amount of grain to give it a slightly darker more film feel. here’s my take on it.",

It breaks the photo into two distinct zones that my eye just jumps back and forth between.\n\nThe fix in Photoshop is dead simple though if you have a reasonably recent version. This is essentially a perfect case study for content aware scale. That tool will get you at least 90% there on its own.\n\nEdit: more like 99% there. This took me all of 5 seconds",

That's for the color version.\n\nimage_url\n\nBut lets be real. You took this picture because you saw you minimism, even if you didn't know it at the time. So I took the edited colored image made it a BW version in which I cropped in further using the rule of 3rds. I increased the contrast, lowered the blacks, upped the whites and highlights. I crashed the structure to make the water a bit more \"smooth\".\n\nimage_url\n\nI'm a hobbyist, I personally think I suck at taking a photo on the spot, but I think I'm good at finding a photo after the fact in post.

This kinda has a story line to it in a way. Also the red shirt vs green is nice. Red shirt really pops against the blue sky.\n\nIn my opinion, it looks like you may have over sharpened it. It doesn't look natural to me but it's not way over either. I do see some opportunities to push the tones around a bit more but keep it mild. That's all personal preference - I do believe this could be a very strong B&W photo. Awesome shot all around, my Instagram is @ericv.photo - reach out I'm happy to look at more of your work and share some of mine - cheers",

There’s no subject here to draw to, just chaos, a cacophony of light and humanity, but not really identifying with anything particular. As an illustrative shot, \"This is what Times Square at night looks like\" for some educational reference, it’s fine and gets that across. As an image to make someone stop and take notice, it just doesn’t have a focus of interest to draw the viewer in. Always stop and ask yourself, \"Why am I taking this picture?

However, this takes my focus to the mountains and the first thing I notice is that colors are very muted/dull and the fog/clouds are a a bit over exposed.\n\nSome potential edits (I’m using lightroom) would be to first move your highlights way down as this will help with the clouds and fog. Next bring your shadows up as this will bring out details in trees and the mountains a bit. Next go into the color mixer and play around with the green and blue. After this maybe consider applying two gradient filters, one for the mountains and another for the water. You can play around with the lighting details on both of these. For the gradient filter applied to the sky, head to the effects tab and add texture, clarity, a a little dehaze. Then for the water gradient filter maybe consider taking the temperature down a bit and playing with the color and saturation.\n\nI’m no whiz at post processing so take my suggestions with a grain of salt. I did a quick edit on my phone incorporating what I mentioned above and came up with this for your shot.\n\nimage_url\n\nEdit: To get more of your landscape in focus consider using a smaller aperture (higher f-stop number) .",

Now it's trendy to crush blacks while also pulling them up, that's a way of underexposing without having the contrast pop up and it looks nice on mobile screens because they are punchy and constrasty. I would have this picture with a little more exposure, and cooler colors for mood. Like this: image_url\n\nI also cropped it to 16x9 because there was too much foreground and it was not interesting. Too much uninteresting foreground is also something usual when shooting landscapes and cityscapes for the first time.\n\nI balanced the colors torwards a colder palette to keep the cinematic colder \"mood\" you had on the original pics. There are some halos but it's because I didn't took too much time to correctly mask each building and because of posterisation due to editing a .jpg.\n\nI'm not completely sure of what and how you want to show artistically on this picture so sorry if I'm not getting the message and \"ruined\" your pic.",

There needs to be more selective contrast both in luminosity and colour in order to give more dimensionality to the image. This is particularly true in the mid-tones of the canyon walls, which have tons of detail but no pop (the darks need to be darkened and the lights lightened.) This is true also of the water. I'm not suggesting that you just pump the contrast. Adjustments need to be selective but more luminosity and colour contrast would really take this image to the next level.",

For one there is some interesting texture on the road in the foreground and in the cloud that you could bring to life with a little contrast.

I know you appreciate working in Lightroom so I also suggest you...\n\nHow to improve in Post: The top is too bright and overexposed.

Put color smoothness (in noise reduction section) up, maybe to 100. You lose a slight amount of color fidelity in the image, but it should even out those patches. Then add a bit of luminance noise reduction, maybe 20 or 30 or so and just play with it a bit.\n\nYou also don't mention what camera you are shooting with or what settings you are using... so I can only speculate that the splotchy noise is from raising the exposure in post. So if you aren't nailing the exposure in camera make sure you nail the exposure in camera. If that means turning up the ISO a bit, do that. Alternately, use a tripod and you wont have to worry about it too much as you can set a longer shutter speed on a lower ISO.\n\nAnd then resize your image for your output medium, if its to display online, resize down, it will help with the noise instead of just presenting a full size image.",

First of all you have to to be sure that there is nothing left on the edges from the former picture which you don't want in the final one. You can remove the unwanted pixels for example with stamp tool - it should be easy in that case.\n\nThan you need to blur the edges a bit. To do that, you can use the tool which you can find in photoshop under the water drop symbol on the left panel (dunno how it is called). Just zoom the picture, spend a time with it, and it will look much better. It will need some work, but that's the deal.\n\nAnd finally, that's the way which I would use.

Instead of leading the eye into the frame they mostly lead across it. Does that make sense. If you get the chance to reshoot, I would try picking some different positions. Work the angles.\n\nI'm also not sold on the rusty thing in the foreground. It's somewhat interesting, but it's also kind of ugly in what is otherwise a beautiful, natural scene.\n\nIf you don't have the chance to reshoot I think you could probably make some improvement by just cropping in from the left. There's a lot of space there that I don't think is doing anything for you.",

Mastering the variety of possible grids leads to many subtle and interesting effects.\n\nimage_url\n\nWe see that the general use of the \"Rule of Thirds\" is good.\n\nGreater precision enhances the effect.\n\nThere is a concept in portraits called \"the dominant eye\" which merely means which eye is more prominent in the photo. Normally this is the eye that is closest to the camera. In a full frontal portrait you would have to use your best judgment based on the expression of the model.\n\nIn this photo, we can line up the dominant eye so that it is precisely on the 1/3rd line. This can be accomplished by cropping in from the top and right side.\n\nimage_url\n\nwith grid\n\nimage_url\n\nThe new defect is that the model's head and shoulder become too close to the edges of the photo. The alternative is to add more image along the left and bottom.\n\nThus this sort of this thing requires extra planning and extra space so that you give yourself more options.\n\nBut for a general shot, the use of the rule of thirds does not need to be very precise.",

As for the colour, it's hard to say anything particularly stands out, except the warm spot in the middle that catches the eye, but is far away and lacks reason to justify doing so. I think a lot of the reason it looks out of place is that the dark flora is blocking it in hard. To show what I mean, I've removed some of the blocking. In my example, I personally see more of a smooth gradient of central warmth radiating out to the edges of the photo. Hope this helps with something. Again, very cool photo.",

Just vertical lines, a white top and your wife.\n\nThe 3rd i tried to make it more like your original. Made her more prominent and cropped to her hand. I also straightened it a smidgen.\n\nOverall my advice would be to Keep It Simple. Less is more. More wife, less background.\n\nAlso, try to get the eyes in the shot. She is looking down, and her face has little expression. If she was looking slightly up at the camera and smiling, it’d make the world of difference. To me, a portrait is all about the face - if you have the eyes and the expression perfect, the rest is secondary.",

        "comment": "The image is a bit flat. Well mainly just in the top half.\n\nI have to ask, when your camera does the HDR for you, does it spit out a jpg? Because I would personally say, keep shooting RAW and switch to doing your HDR images manually. That way you retain the RAW images, you can edit in full 16 bit color, and you have full control over the process.\n\nYour camera did a decent job overall and its definitely not something I would say is overdone, but it also seems to have compressed the dynamic range a bit too far. In fact its compressed it far enough that my first glance at the image made it seem like the dynamic range was low enough that you shouldnt have even needed to do any kind of HDR process. And I am further still unsure of that because the lights being on in the park and the way the buildings are lit make it seem like this is probably after the sun has set, which again makes me wonder how necessary HDR actually was. Certainly not a 6 shot HDR, but maybe 2 would have sufficed.\n\nBack to what I was saying though. I would personally aim to maximize the dynamic range of the finished image and brighten up the background and bring overall contrast back up. The sky and the reflected lights on the buildings should be closer to actual highlights instead of the (dull looking) midtones they are now.",

Second, film actors almost never look right into the camera - it breaks the 4th wall. Films are about telling stories, and the eyes of your subject are telling the story through the scene they are in. So unless you're giving something to indicate, the camera is another actor in the scene, I'd have her looking elsewhere - behind the bar at the waitress (what's the story there?), maybe even her own reflection (is she reflecting on herself), maybe she's looking over her shoulder or toward the entrance (being followed). Lots of stuff you can do with that.\n\nThe photo you took is definitely film-esque, but not quite cinematic. It's a good image, however. I'd be tempted to crop it down a little and play with some luminosity masking to paint in some light on the girl to separate her a bit and put some light in her face. Of course, you can introduce some grain to look a little more filmy but I'd use a very light hand to avoid getting to kitschy.

However, for me, the biggest problem is the flattening of the dynamic range. The stand of trees could be much more interesting but you'd have to bring in more contrast and clarity to give the colour field more dimension. There is something going on with the mountain as well. It appears to be glowing behind the trees. Is that haze or mist or is it an artifact of some sort? Overall the image is very flat due to the flattening of the dynamic range.

The outcropping on the right is really dominant, but it's not the focus of the image.\n\nThe haze in the distance is also high. A lot of folks would probably tell you to use an ND filter and get a longer exposure.\n\nIn editing the things you can do are add more drama, so here are things I'd do:\n\nReplace the clouds or mess with contrast and highlights to give them some shape and movement. The sky also looks really dark as is.\n\nBump shadows and contrast on the left cliffs.\n\nSee if there is a crop that reduces the impact of the rocks to your right, or removes them altogether.",

The rock and the point of interest (and the oranges) are all on the left side of the frame. I also am not sure the rock here is the best choice of foreground, its nice, but its not all that interesting especially since it kind of feels like it was an afterthought given its position in the frame. Maybe a wider view to give the rock more context or something. Also possibly processing it differently so it doesnt blend in so much to the water.\n\nWithout knowing your shooting settings though, I cant offer much else in terms of how you shot this or give much more advice on how I might have shot it differently.",

Perhaps this is subjective but for me only two things really take away from the picture/look a little unnatural:\n\nI read the comments where you mentioned liking/wanting to bring out the green in the water at the front. I do find it fairly distracting as is but I think if you could tone it down just a tad it would look less edited. (Maybe less luminosity there? Hard to say for sure without playing around with it myself). Or perhaps \"toning up\" other areas of water so they don't stand out as quite as dull in comparison. I really like the colors you've got going on it's just that certain areas look a little too flat in comparison.\n\nOnly other thing is the mountains in the left of the photo. I actually really like the sky as-is, but I think the mountains almost look a little too clouded for their distance- and sort of a weird combo of obscured in clouds but also high in brightness maybe? It looks weird given the relative clarity/darkness of most other landmasses in the photo, like maybe a little edited in looking. I think the photo would benefit from those mountains looking a little more \"solid\" or maybe having more color? Something to help them contrast more from flat sea/sky in that area of the photo.\n\nOverall though, fantastic job! Seriously gorgeous photo.",

Their eyes are not actually black pits of Stygian despair... there's almost always a clearly defined iris and a pupil and they're usually quite colorful. Sometimes your exposure is such that you end up underexposing the eye and it's crushed out 100% black. If so don't worry about it. This shot however - you captured that detail. I can see it when I enbiggen it. Now I want to see it in the finished image :p\n\nYou cannot get too carried away however - just a slight bump. Use a Curves layer in PS, bring up the brightness (a LOT, a huge amount), then put a negative mask over the whole layer. A soft white brush at ~3% opacity and 0% hardness, zoom all the way in on the eye - and lightly start to brush in that brightness on the eye (and do the same using a saturation layer too)\n\nIf you push it too hard it very rapidly starts looking exactly like you brightened it too much in post, so be super conservative as you do it. It does however make a difference (at least it does for me. Some people might like the Demon Bird look though ;) )\n\nRepresentative sample image: image_url",

That really takes a toll on saturation.

        "comment": "This is fantastic, overall, and you should be proud of it. You have accomplished the hardest, and most important aspect of landscape photography. You were in the right place at the right time. That was either good luck, or good planning. What separates the pro landscape photographers from everyone else is their ability to consistently get themselves into the right place at the right time.\n\nThere are a few things that I think could probably be improved here. I say probably because I don’t know exactly what you were working with, or what you are going for. So as always take these suggestions for what they are. (I also don’t know your experience level so I apologize if this is too far over your head, or too dumbed down.)\n\nYou have a little bit of rock outcropping in the bottom right. As is, I find it distracting. In general, it’s better to either “use it or lose it.” If you have something in your foreground it needs to be fully included as part of your overall composition. Or it needs to be excluded entirely. (You probably would have needed to find a different place to stand.)\n\nEither can be a good choice, though in this case I probably would have eliminated it. You don’t need to add a strong foreground element in this shot, especially in that corner of the frame. It’s competing with other elements of your image. You already have a lot going on.\n\nSomething to change for next time, unfortunately. You could try cropping it out, but that would also lose some of the leading lines on the left, so I doubt that’s any improvement.\n\nI also think this would probably have worked better if it was horizontal rather than vertical. Generally, a vertical composition emphasizes depth and/or tall objects. Horizontal emphasizes the horizon, open spaces, and lateral movement. Either can be an excellent choice for a landscape depending on the scene and your artistic intent, so there’s not necessarily a hard and fast rule about when to use either.\n\nIn my opinion though, this scene is begging to be horizontal. The drama of the shot comes from the transition in the weather and the lighting. When I look at this I see bright and stormy sunshine on the top right, moving into dark and stormy on the bottom left. That’s primarily a lateral transition, visually, and so I think a horizontal crop would have been much more effective.\n\nI also find myself wanting to see a lot more of the scene on the right. It feels cut off and unbalanced. You want the canyon to fill most of the frame, but you also want to keep the dark areas and negative space on the lower left. That requires more of the canyon to be included on the right. Does that make sense? Again, I can’t be certain since I wasn’t there and don’t know what you were working with, but I keep wanting to see more on the right. A horizon composition also would have helped with this as well.\n\nYou also have too much sky. I suggest cropping some of it out. The dark tones add some drama, so don’t go too far, but the subject is the canyon and the weather along the horizon.\n\nMost of the things I mentioned are in camera, but if you can spare the resolution I definitely recommend changing the crop. I took the liberty of trying a couple. These are just suggestions. You might also want do some dodging and burning afterwards to make sure you still have a good range of tone and contrast where you want it.\n\nimage_url This one is a lot better, in my opinion. Still cramped on the right and still has a distracting foreground, but it doesn’t have as much dead space.\n\nOr, alternatively: image_url\n\nThis one cuts out the foreground entirely. You do lose some of the tonal range though, and the leading lines towards the bottom left, plus a fair amount of resolution. Something to consider though. Again, a lot of this is not a right or wrong thing, it just depends on your goals.\n\nHopefully that all makes sense. I’m a bit sleep deprived :) Let me know if you have follow up questions.\n\nThis was an excellent choice to submit for critique, by the way. You’ve got a great scene, wonderful light, and no big technical issues as far as I can tell, which gives us a chance to dive into some of the artistic aspects.\n\nWell done. Definitely one to hang on the wall.\n\nEdit: If those crops are too severe for you, even this would probably be a significant improvement. image_url",

The starting point of the rails in the frame are not equal. Also always pay attention to the the horizon. It's simply not level here. Always check that in your workflow.\n\nThe color edit: check your histogram. You will see it lacks contrast. As result you have a lot of mid tones. That makes it dull/flat. Noting 'pops'. The color has too much magenta for me (purple).\n\nI think with a more neutral edit, you might have had a better result.",

It's exposed well but that doesn't necessarily mean you did a good stacking job. Ideally you'd want to do long exposure exposed for the water and short one for the trees plus maybe one more for the sky if it's still too bright and then blend them in photoshop. You can add focus stacking to the process as well if your 35mm is unable to get the whole scene sharp at good for your lens sharpness aperture. I can't really tell how well you did since the quality of the image is not great and you haven't explained your technique.\n\nAs far as the image itself goes I believe it's just a test shot with no other purpose right? So lets not criticize on the composition. One thing I do have to point out is that the colors and leveling are really off.\n\nI would like to know where in the image have you focused in each one from the stack, what stacking or blending technique in which program have you used and what were the settings and filters used for each image of the stack. Then I can help you more in pointing problems and the things you did well with the stacking job.\n\nEdit: Due to the weird color I have missed that some of the rocks in the middle are blown out so it's not well exposed.",

Or did you simply use the center focus point to focus on the face, and neglect to recompose?\n\nWhatever the truth, for me, I will certainly tend to assume the latter. Unless I can see a really strong compositional reason to put the face dead-center, it looks to me that you did a newbie mistake and failed to recompose.\n\nI'll let you be the judge, though.

I'm not sure if there are guidelines for dogs specifically, but when shooting people you never crop through a joint (unless you realllllly want to, to mess with people) and you did that to the dog... I feel like it's similar. A few more inches of dog would be so nice. Or all of the dog. Yes, all of the dog. More dog more better.\n\nThings I do like - the light is very nice, and the best part of this is the bike and fence in the background - which turn this from a photo of a dog looking into the sunset into something much more. Something with context that makes you feel like you are there. That's really cool and it's tough to pull off.\n\nYour questions about where to stand, and what lens (or zoom) to use are awesome. There is no one answer, but it's good that you are thinking about these questions. Too many people don't think about what they are shooting, and what the best way to do that may be and their photos fall flat... Every scene is different, so there is no really good answer. People develop something of a style (or bias) but sometimes a certain thing just has to be shot a certain way.\n\nTl/Dr - the light, bike/fence, and a better crop of the dog would be an outstanding photo.

Every image that isn’t part of a set needs to work on it’s own. And if it does work, and looks good, if it happens to be unfaithful to the discipline of rock climbing, that doesn’t betray the photographic value. If it looks good, use it.

If it’s in the shot it should be part of a coherent composition, not just there. If it’s not helping you it’s hurting you.\n\nAnd yes, make sure your subject is clear and framed well.\n\nFor example, here’s a good photo with the same basic theme. I just pulled this off of google. Sorry for the image quality.\n\nimage_url\n\nNow, there’s a lot of stuff going on here, but you see how everything in the frame is laid out so that it’s visible? There’s an easy flow from one abject to the next, and an overall sense of balance. No one object truly dominates the composition. The background is fairly clean, but fits with the aesthetic of the shot and provides context. The chair helps tell a story, because it looks like someone is getting ready for a trip, and has all his gear ready for the next day.

The rest of your lighting situation that day wasn't ideal, which is why you've had so much trouble with trying to balance it out in post. Next time, try directing the model to rotate her position/tilt her head relative to the light source. You're going to have to shoot through some different angles, but eventually you should find a sweet spot that works for your model's features. Alternatively, she (or an assistant) could have held the hat out to the side so that the brim was blocking out most of the sun and casting that patterned shadow across more of her face.\n\nI find her expression a little flat. Direct your models to convey a specific mood or feeling. There's just not enough going on with her expression to tell a story.\n\nIt looks like you isolated the left eye and adjusted the levels. I'd avoid trying to pull that much detail out of the shadows when working on eyes. It's quite noticeable, and tends to not only give the image an overprocessed look, but also interrupts the flow of the visual story and draws attention to the retouching instead.\n\nKeep it up, you've got a clear vision and aesthetic that you're chasing here.

But you don't really emphasize it much. It's just there. This is a visually interesting situation, and you had an idea of what you wanted to emphasize. But you didn't follow through with it.\n\nWhat if you stood more to your left, so that the sun highlights of the sun took up more than half of the face, from your perspective?\n\nWhat if you got closer to the model, so that the hat and the highlights took up more of the frame?\n\nWhat if she were tilting her head in an enticing or interesting pose, instead of facing straight ahead?\n\nWhat if she tilted her head in such a way as to make more of the bright spots?\n\nWhat if her eyes were closed, and you saw the bright spots on her eye?\n\nWhat if you were so close that the portrait became almost an abstract composition of sun and shadow, and maybe an eye and a smile?\n\nI don't know which, if any of my suggestions above would work. But I suspect they would all be more interesting than a bland, symmetrical, straightforward, expressionless portrait.\n\nMy suggestion would have been to take 6, 10, 20 shots of the model, trying different things, always trying to make each one better than the last (ie, not spraying and praying but really thinking about each shot). Really try to emphasize the interesting specific element that attracted you in the first place.\n\nHope this helps!",

        "comment": "My 2c here is my edit: image_url\n\n1.) I understand the restrictions of shooting but I have to agree, landscape orientation over portrait. If you really like portrait, I would suggest either selecting a detail on the car and framing it (like a close up) or doing a small two-step panorama and stitching together the photos in post. However, if you do the panorama, don't pan or you'll barrel distort the overall photo, hence the two step side step ;).\n\n2.) Composition. You're eye level with the height of the rear tail lights which gives us a great view of under the vehicle AND under the spoiler but, due to the crop/framing, the spoiler physically cuts the space in half and creates a distraction. You can always untie the knot as the rope is pretty distracting or remove it in Photoshop. I personally would have gotten lower to the ground, let the back end frame itself! No need for leaves or bushes in the background and getting lower, the leaves would not make the frame and the trees would be more hidden behind the car. It would also be great to see right under the vehicle to the front bumper as the shadow underneath the car is underexposed. Being a raw file, you can probably recover detail in Lightroom.\n\n3.) Aperture. Offers a great depth of field but it's too shallow. The lights and lambo badge are crispy sharp but the tires start to get soft and the middle silver badge looks to be out of focus when really it's solved with just a touch slower aperture. As you say, you couldn't move back so I would get as much in focus as possible and you can always background bokeh/blur in Photoshop. You can add blur later, but you can't add focus later!\n\nI suspect being a car show that there were other cars next to it, hence the tight framing. If that was the case, include those cars, context provides a story to the photo!\n\nAlways try new angles, change settings, wait for better light etc. I made my edit desaturated as I really wanted to focus to be the lights and found the gray sky to be.. well... Gray and the green trees are competing for eye space. All in all, good photo and fun to edit. You can always do a background replacement too and make this a portfolio piece for product photography!",

The easiest fix for that is to brighten just the house and other stonework. It should work in b/w as well. What I see in your photo is both an extreme amount of contrast and clarity/structure and an overall reduction in light. It seems like there is no grey or grades of tone, just the extremes of black or white like you would get with a black ink drawing.\n\nThe image is so extreme in its effects that you must have had an idea of what you wanted but that I can't appreciate.

I don't think there is a problem with losing the dog into the background with my edit, though. There may also be some shade on the dog's head, since its head seems darker than its chest. If it mattered, I might work more on counteracting that.\n\nOf course, there is no \"correct\" edit, just whatever you prefer for your own tastes.\n\nI usually prefer a less-is-more look.

As Far as Getting the \"Motion\" in to the picture, I set my camera to high sped continuous shoot and had the mom spin with the baby in her arms. that's how the hair and legs are shown as \"reaching\" out towards the edges of the screen.\n\nHere is a second edit of the picture using the recommendations of the comments: image_url\n\nHere is the original in JPG Format. I have the the RAW version too but its too big to post: image_url\n\nThanks All for your feedback! it's much appreciated!",

There is no need to artificially focus the eye on the centre, the viewer's eye travels nicely around the frame picky up the grime and detail and comes back to the centre somewhat naturally as is, I think we as people focus on the door and windows. As I wrote this comment , I noticed I had scrolled up on the image and realized I was missing some of the ceiling.

Brightest parts of a scene or highest contrast points in a scene (often one and the same) attract perhaps unwanted attention from your viewers. They become distractions.

However if you want people to stop scrolling on your photo, usually a more square aspect ratio is best because with a wide and short aspect ratio, like in your pic, the detail is minimal.\n\nIf you are framing to display in your home the classic aspect ratios are easier to find frames for, and to be honest they look better in most situations. A 16:9 print is hard to find a frame for and hard to find a spot for on a wall. That's just IMHO.",

You can also utilize the timer to reduce camera shake from pressing the button.\n\nOn the RP, ISO 50 is not a native ISO. Instead, it is emulated by capturing an overexposed shot and then post processing it. There's quite the controversy, as to what that implies for your image. But I'd suggest to shoot at ISO100, which will help you to reduce shutter speed, thereby also reducing blur due to atmosphere and moon movement.\n\nDepending on your lens, you might also find that a narrower aperture might create sharper results.\n\nThe magnifier of the RP can help you to nail focus when you utilize the manual focus.",

Make it so you can still tell it's blossoms, but make the subject pop a bit more. Also, it looks like you're using a lens that is too wide for portraiture, resulting in some distortion of the subject. If you used a longer lens, you'd get something more natural looking.

But the question I have to ask is why this wasn't shot portrait style togove a heavy focus. There's a lot of dead space that doesn't matter and a complicated subject in he center. Reframing this as a portrait shot would make it much more impactful imo.\n\nSomething like this gives us every chance to observe the details of what you're holding without distraction of the dead space and how you position it can lead the eyes directly to the relevant cross points for immediate focus.\n\nimage_url\n\nTo me the shot is way more interesting as a portrait orientation and tight in.\n\nGood effort. Interesting idea. The missing head does make this more like digital art that photography. If it was just stacked exposure it would still be more photography. I don't mind digital art but I do consider it a different art form than photography.\n\nOverall interesting and good job",

This is easily fixable obviously. And the reason this is happening is that your shots lit with the stobes are competing with the existing light. It was a good move opting to composite, and this is the industry standard when working digitally. There are some problems here though. You're left with a really unbalanced image when the right side of the photograph is so dark. I would bring this up a tad so it's less distracting.\n\nIf you look at the windows you've dropped in, it looks as if they're glowing from where you've feathered the selection. A better move is to composite the windows using a harder brush and then reduce the opacity of the selection slightly to make them look more natural.\n\nIf you look at a publication, you'll also never see smoke detectors / ceiling speakers / some kinds of recessed lighting.

I work in film, VFX/CGI, and have done a fair amount of color grading professionally.\n\nWhat we often do to give a shot a softer look, is to lift the blacks. And I don't mean to slide the \"blacks\" slider up in lightroom or photoshop. You're going to want to go to edit the curves, and make it look something like this:\n\nimage_url\n\nNot EXACTLY like that, but grab the bottom left point, and lift it up slightly. Be very subtle with it, as it does not take very much for the effect to show up, it's easily overdone. But what this will do, will essentially reduce the harsh contrast between the front dark trees/messy branches/exposed leaves, and the bright snow, helping them blend together a little bit better. If you set your curve points properly, only the darkest parts of the image will be affected, and your beautiful, misty background, and snow, will be completely unaffected. Worst case scenario, add a layer mask on your curves adjustment layer (if you're working in PS), and mask out the parts you don't want affected.\n\nI hope this helps out a bit, and once again, FANTASTIC WORK. Keep it up good sir!",

        "comment": "Why did you change the aperture? That will alter the depth of field sharpness of what's in focus (ie: to infinity). That's likely why the background is soft.\n\nWhile bracketing you should lock focus, metering/AEL, aperture and ISO and just change shutter speed. The valley is not moving anywhere so 1/500 or 1/4 of a second will be an identical frame to match up. Maintaining the same focus and aperture will ensure everything has the same outline, it's just darker or lighter.\n\nAs for the composition the horizon shouln't be in the middle of the picture, it should be on the rule of thirds (either golden ratio or exact third). The snow in the foreground is also kind of boring and distracting, and dirty looking, especially with the footprints. I would have either gone to the ridge, or tried something else like putting the camera down close to the ground and leaving the foreground blurry/out of focus. Also a portrait orientation is more flattering to that type of foreground: ie: image_url",

It is a panda,it is in focus without motion blur, and he does seem to be doing something other than sleeping so all of that is good. Your general positioning of the panda by the rule of thirds also works.... But, it doesn't seem super playful really, you can only see part of one of his eyes, and otherwise it looks like he's just kinda laying there. It's not a very dynamic photo that doesn't have interesting light to save it.\n\nZoos are really hard places to take photos. Your 135mm lens should help, but it's probably not quiiiite long enough for many of the outdoor enclosures. Get on the same level as the animal, shooting down or up dramatically just takes the viewer out of the photo...it feels too much like an observer. Get the animals eyes, preferably with catchlights if you can. Do everything you can to make the photo feel like it wasn't taken at a zoo.\n\nGood attempt for not knowing what you're doing.

Your foreground is in shadow, so you have to decide what is more important, foreground or background and the white balance for that. Conversely you can do a local adjustment on just the foreground (warm up the foreground and leave the BG)- if you shot in raw this is very easy to do in ACR. Otherwise can be achieved in PS or LR.\n\nThe light coming over the mountains is beautiful, and the light cover over snow, with the sparse clouds makes for a really beautiful scene. However, I'm having trouble finding a subject in the image. It would be nice to maybe see the back of a person standing on the trail- gives scale and a subject. Or if you shifted your perspective lower on the trail so we saw some of the rocks/chains/maybe foliage (is there any?) larger and broke up the composition.\n\nP.S. I don't think I would mind the separation in tones being obvious.. your foreground is in shadow, so if you balance for your foreground (which generally contains your subject and should be balanced) then your background will be more yellow, but we can see the sunlight peeking over so that makes sense.",

The tint is clearly too green and perhaps a bit too blue.\n\nThe other things you could do with color is even out your skin tone, and do a little color grading to get the twinkle lights to be a bit warmer to match your skin tone better for a more cohesive color scheme.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the chin-up pose because of what it does to your neck and jawline. Also your framing is a bit awkward. Vertical portraits tend to not look as good at 3:2, unfortunately you didn't get enough space around you to get a nice 4:3 or5:4 crop.\n\nSee this alternative edit for an example of how I would process this.",

This photo is a great example of what it looks like. An explanation. \"What does the Louvre look like at night?\" It answers that question.\n\nI would love to see an argument in this photo. Instead of just \"this is what the Louvre looks like,\" you could show me \"this is a specific detail of the Louvre at night that I think is beautiful\" or \"this is a specific angle of the Louvre at night that is interesting.\"\n\nIf I look up \"Louvre at night\" I will probably see thousands of photos arguing \"the reflection looks pretty.\" I don't need another person to tell me that. Let me walk through this frame up close to the actual pyramid. Let me see someone looking at it with their face lit by the lights. Point out some symmetry, some leading lines, a unique sunset. Show me something I can't see anywhere except for your photo.\n\nBasically, if you have some battery life left, after taking the more standard postcard shots it might be fun to play around with a less conventional way of exploring the scene.\n\nA couple potato quality crops of your image to show some ideas I had, if you're ever back at the site to take more photos:\n\nplay with the surface of the actual pyramid to get some cool geometry or symbols to emerge out of it image_url\n\nplay with the reflection by taking a photo and flipping it somehow image_url",

So I think this could stand to have a good chunk of the sky cropped out. Its flat and dull and not adding anything to this shot.\n\nOverall, it looks like a good pano. I dont see any seams or any really obvious color or brightness shifts. Though the gradient in the sky is a bit blotchy in places, as it seems to be darker in the center with the bright areas going higher on the sides, its almost unnoticeable, but again could probably be helped by the crop.\n\nAs far as what else can be done to improve this... probably not too much, as you already mentioned, the light is pretty bad. Great light for a snapshot, but terrible light for landscape photography.\n\nAs far as using an ND or a polarizer to enhance this shot, well, I cant say that I think either would have helped. It looks like you already captured the entire dynamic range of the scene in your individual shots, so a grad ND wouldnt have done much and a solid ND could allow for longer exposures but to what end? There are barely any clouds in the sky for movement and the water down below is too far away to have a huge effect, plus you would just end up smoothing out the little bit of texture that is there.\n\nAs for a polarizer, well, at the relatively wide angles you were shooting this at, it would cause much more issues than it would help with unless you were willing to essentially bracket your shots and do even more advanced blending in post. What the polarizer would do is create very uneven brightness and saturation levels in the sky. It would have helped with the trees up close a little bit, but you would then probably want to have an unpolarized sky panorama blended with the polarized ground pano.\n\nOf course without a tripod, you wouldnt have been able to do much of that anyways. And again, with the light as it is, I am really not sure any of those things would have made much if any difference, except make your life harder or make the image worse.",

There are three that give a pretty good result, Kodachrome, Ektachrome, and Tri-pan X for black and white. Whether you can get them to work at all, it is very useful to open each up and look at the individual steps involved in the Actions. Once you have an idea of how they get the film color, you'll be able to replicate it in your own individual way. A note about your photo: CLEAN IT UP! Meaning, before you try to edit the tone (or show it to anyone) you need to fix some things. Get rid of the mess at the bottom left by cropping or cloning out that entire area. It adds nothing to the photo but chaos. Simple is almost always better. Also systematically (for every photo, every time, before you show it to anyone) scan the entire image at 100% - start at top left, move slowly across to far right, drop down a screen length, then scan back, etc. until you've scanned the entire photo at 100%. Use the Clone tool the whole time to remove small blemishes or distracting details. This will do a lot to clean up the photograph. In general, you have a decent composition of an interesting subject. I love the idea of the film look for this photo. I think if you spend some more time on getting out the clutter and adjusting the tone (maybe also add a bit of Vibrance and Contrast) you will have something you can be proud to hang on your wall.",

Glad to hear the blur worked out.\n\nWhen looking at a higher resolution image the blemishes don't stick out nearly as much, but if you look at a large thumbnail sized image they tend to be a bit more noticeable (pixel densities ftl). Here are the specific points I'm talking about: image_url\n\nNow that I've pulled the image into Photoshop, I was 100% wrong about a 4x5 crop, that was stupid advice and don't take it into consideration at all. Is this an uncropped image?\n\nAlso, because I pulled it into Photoshop and gave it a bit more in depth look, I might raise the brightness/vibrancy of her lips by a touch. Again, there is nothing wrong with it and this is very minor nit-picking, but I think some slight adjustments could bring a bit more attention to her lips helping the image...

Then pay attention to how your eyes move through the photo.\n\nThe issue for me is you have 3 different objects in the photo that could be your subject but none of them stand out. The cottage, the yellow tree and all the sheep. All three compete for my attention and my eye never really settles on one of them because none of the three stands out, it is just to busy.\n\nIf you wanted the attention on the house and tree there is nothing wrong with sheep in the foreground but they have to be much less prominent. Especially the ones in the shadows! As is they carry about as much weight as everything else in the photo.\n\nI think the shot would look better in a landscape orientation. After all this is a landscape photo. You have a lot of sky that is not really adding much to the photo.\n\nI have read photography described as a Subtractive Art. You remove everything from the photo that isn't adding to or improving it. So next time take a moment to look over the scene and plan the shot a little before you pick up your camera. Then when you lift your camera look around the frame at everything that you are about the capture, not just focusing on the one thing. It takes time but it will really improve your photography.",

Also, the lines of the cottage and the prominent yellow tree are fighting against the horizontal as well.\n\nA second issue is that the roles that the various objects play - subject, supporting elements - is not clear. The out-of-focus, dark sheep in the foreground are the major problem here; I feel like they're not the subject since they're out of focus and darker...but they are as large as any other elements in the image. Maybe crop them out? Also, the next line of sheep don't seem to be in focus, but they are pretty close to one of the thirds lines of the image, which is pretty confusing for my eye.\n\nHere is my attempt at editing this image in darktable.

You've got a great style - I'd love to see more.\n\nFRAMING\n\nYou had an excellent eye for this shot. The large dark trees form a great natural border - they are eloquently a part of the scenery, but their darker tones draw the audience deeper into the subject: your foggy, mysterious canopy. It works; it's cropped perfectly even. But that brings me to the first issue I have... the scene is too wide.\n\nCROP\n\nSquare crops are the bane of photography. There is rarely a scene that works better as a square crop - and I personally don't think this is one of them. I would honestly rather see you photoshop one side in and shrink the canvas' width. A vertical crop here would be much more pleasing, alluring to the natural landscape of trees. I know the world is social media based, but Instagram has molded to fit larger photos and I would hate to see this photo go unprinted. Printed art is another level of beauty - I didn't realize it until I started printing my own stuff!\n\nEDITING\n\nMild issues here. Your light source is near to the top of your photo, leaving your eyes stuck there. The darkness covering the bottom half portion isn't as approachable as I would like it. The middle tree seems like the subject, but the light quickly pulls the audience away. I would recommend selectively brightening the middle range of the photo. Lightroom would do great for this, whether brushed or radial. I wouldn't go so far as a light leak, but there is some range for creative editing.\n\nNot much to really critique (you didn't do enough stuff poorly! Haha)! It's a simple, but intriguing shot. I like it - I would love to see it printed and matted (but that relies on you cropping differently). Besides that, take every word I wrote with a few grains of salt: art is subjective. As objective as we make it when we critique, at the end of the day your improvement is more important than one opinion being right or wrong. Just. Keep. Shooting. That's my only advice.\n\nI'd like to see the two framing trees with a more layered look; like you're peeking between them at this scene, but if you could go back, what would you have done differently?",

You'll never know just by looking at the picture that it was taken during a super moon because there is no context -- who's to say you didn't just zoom in a little bit more.

If there was more of the ocean I would have probably added that back in to give the boat more breathing space in the picture.\n\nI also rotated the picture clockwise since the roads felt very tilted in the original photograph.\n\nFinally i desaturated the vegetation and ocean (yellows and green in the HSL panel) to place more emphasis on the people in blue.\n\nEDIT the second crop tells a completely different story since the road gets cropped off. However it helps condense the photo by removing the empty space on the top left of the photo and balances the focus of the overall photo. I prefer the composition of the second crop, but it defeats the continuity of the journey and makes it look like a boundary instead.",

        "comment": "What a fantastic shot! It's very dramatic, albeit, as other comments point out, the edit is a bit flat. Here's a couple of things I'd do on top of your existing edits:\n\nThe foreground texture doesn't add much to the photo. In fact, it's distracting a bit from the star of the show: the water. So I'd make it completely black, or almost-completely. It would also increase the water contrast, which helps, too.\n\nDodge and burn the water a little, to make it more three dimensional. With the help of luminosity masks to keep it more natural.\n\nI'd _consider_ setting the white point lower, too. Currently, the brightest tones are still quite dark. But when I tried that, it quickly started to look bad, with the top part of the water looking fake.\n\nI'd also consider brightening the edges of the water, to separate it from the rock at the bottom and sky at the top. Luminosity masks would help again.\n\nHere's a quick and dirty example of the first two points:\n\nimage_url\n\nWorking with the raw file, you'd achieve much better results. The black and white conversion in particular gives some room for play - for example by darkening blues you could make the water stand out much more against the sky, which is in very similar tones currently.",

You could use the colors to your advantage and get as creative as you want by tinkering with the HSL sliders. There's visible grain and movement in the trees, therefore I'd take it easy with the sharpening and clarity.\n\nIf you use a healing or clone tool, remember that you'll do it twice since you're working with a reflection, but from the look of it I wouldn't remove anything.\n\nYou got some decent light stars so depending on your equipment and vision, I'd consider using f/11 and a longer shutter.\n\nI hope it's okay that I went ahead did a few edits myself using the lightroom app on my phone. Nothing sophisticated but maybe they can help.

Compositionally, the image features too much water and sky in my opinion. I would be inclined to crop top and bottom and the left side, removing everything past the orange lights. I think you'd have a much stronger image. Technically, there's a lot of blown highlights. That problem can be resolved with blending. Is this a single image or have you already done some blending? This could probably be done with two exposures although three would be better. You need a darks exposure for the highlights - the red hotel sign and most of the lights particularly on the lower level, which are now blown, a slightly brighter base exposure for the midtones and one brighter still to capture the detail in the shadows (although you might be able to get away without that one.)

        "comment": "Personally I think the DOF is too shallow, and the bike seat itself too underexposed if that's the focus. I can't tell how aged the bike seat is, or why it's the point of focus, other than maybe that it serves as a point of focus for the separated background. Aesthetically, it's pretty, but it doesn't tell me why you took the photograph.",

        "comment": "I hope this doesn’t come across as too harsh or rude because this really is coming from a place of constructive thought, but this picture just looks like you got your first wide aperture lens and started taking pictures and settled on this one.\n\nIt appears to be bokeh for the sake of bokeh and not much more, by all means I may be wrong and missing something here but is there anything “story” in this shot or is it just a bike seat and a blurry background?\n\nFor me, it’s a very boring photograph because if the subject is truly the seat, it’s a bit too out of frame for me, and if the background was meant to compliment the scene it’s too out of focus and blurry to achieve that.\n\nWas the seats age supposed to be the story? If so perhaps taking the photo from a foot higher would have been better to show more of the cracks and really make it the focus, doesn’t have to be center but certainly more towards the center than it currently sits.\n\nIf the bike altogether was the subject I don’t like that the handlebars aren’t even completely in the frame and cut off quite awkwardly\n\nThis really looks like you saw the hanging lights, wanted them to make some bokeh and just used a bike seat to achieve that look, which no doubt will give you likes on Instagram because bokeh, but to me it’s an extremely boring shot\n\nPlease don’t take this as a reflection of you or your vision, it’s just my objective opinion of this photograph.",

        "comment": "Agreed on all points.\n\nThe items on the right of the frame are really distracting.\n\nYou can't really tell what they are - so you start trying to figure out what they are. You don't want your viewers to try and figure out what they are because they are of no importance at all to the story you're telling - so get rid of 'em.\n\nCrop in tighter so she sits dead center of the rule-of-thirds line and some combination of clone stamping and filling to get rid of the stuff that's behind her. Something like this (smash-edit proof of concept only)\n\nimage_url\n\nI'm conflicted about the wood - my first instinct is to leave it since it's easy to tell what it is and so the mind dismisses it.",

I do see a lot going on, so your sled guy gets a little lost. I think if you zoomed in on your guy, it could tell a clearer story. You’ve got shops, a delivery van, a cool looking light pole, a car stopped to let your guy cross, and obviously the sled guy. So if you focus more on the guy’s journey, I think it will be more impactful... I did a quick crop to provide an example of the story I see in your photo... that being said, I’m also new to photography and the editing process and we all see things a little differently. Keep snapping those photos!! This is an awesome capture image_url",
